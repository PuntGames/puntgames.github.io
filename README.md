# PuntGames Methods
## Website
This method is the easiest. Go to [the website](https://puntgames.github.io) and click on a game you want to play. It will then immediately open.

## Download Games
If you can access the repository, you can manually download the games and then play them locally on your own computer as HTML files. Most games should be available as .zip files, but if the game isn't, you can just download the entire repository through any method and then get the game from there.
